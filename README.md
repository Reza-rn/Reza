### Hi there! 👋

I'm Reza. I work as a full-time energy system algorithm and software developer. I am very interested on developing various optimization and machine learning algorithms and techniques to apply them on energy systems specifically smart grid technologies to enhance the operation and reduce the overall cost. Some of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused electric distribution networks.
