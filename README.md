### Hi there! üëã  (Under Construction)

I'm Reza. I am sinor software and algorithm developer especially for energy systems. I am very interested on developing various machine learning algorithms especially deep learning and optimization techniques to apply them on various problems mainly in energy systems specifically for smart grid technologies to enhance the operation and reduce the overall cost. 

I am proficient in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, and model deployment. I have successfully designed and implemented multiple machine learning models and solutions in various fields including energy systems, healthcare, and finance. I also have a strong background in data analytics and optimization algorithms including linear, convex, and mixed integer programming. I am experienced in developing software for various machine learning, optimization methods, algorithms, and data structures for various applications including prediction, classification, optimal operation, and control of energy systems. I am highly passionate about using AI algorithms to solve complex problems and improve business outcomes. 

Some of my projects below üëáüèª are focused on machine learning algorithms and optimization method for various applications mainly developed on Python. Also, I have some small sample codes for computer science algorithms and data sctrutures which I really enjoy developing them.
