### Hi there! 👋

I'm Reza. I work as a full-time energy system algorithm and software developer. I am very interested on developing various machine learning algorithms especially deep learning and optimization techniques to apply them on various problems mainly in energy systems specifically for smart grid technologies to enhance the operation and reduce the overall cost. Some of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on optimization and machine learning techniques especially on distribution networks.
